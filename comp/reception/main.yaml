  This is needed for entry control.

  In SR2015 this consisted of four individual desks arranged such that
  one was on each side of two lanes of teams. Crowd barriers guided teams
  from a general queue into these two lanes.

  On each desk the validation of tickets was separated from the crimping
  of the wristbands, with a different volunteer manning each. A small
  number of additional volunteers were also placed around the desks to
  direct people towards their proper pit area and to handle any
  special-cases.
